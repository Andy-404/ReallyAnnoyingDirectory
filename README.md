# ReallyAnnoyingDirectory - Introduction Project

A directory of really 'awful' front-end pages. No Style guide requirements. Template Provided. Write as much or as little as you want. 

## Purpose 

What we're doing here is giving everyone regardless of skill level a chance to contribute to a repository without being terrified of things like styleguides, making people mad (it's kind of the point), and all the other things that come with big scary stuff normally associated with first time collaborations like trying to make stuff with people you've never met who definintely probably maybe know more than you. 

To put it simply, It's designed to be difficult to fuck this up from a new person's perspective. While being 'fun' for everyone.

## Getting Started

Suggested Reading for those new to github

* No modifications to the directory page are allowed **EXCEPT** adding a link to your page. Maintain the directory structure when adding your link

* In the description of the pull request detail what it is your page does that is annoying.
* Only 1 page may be added, but you can go back and update your original page later if you choose to (No external style sheets but CDNs are fine)

## MANDATORY RULES

* Partial secrets/surprises/are acceptable but **nothing** that's NSFW / Screamers / Tubgirl-Lemonparty-esque
