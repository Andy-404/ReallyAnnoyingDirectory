# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of the Really Annoying Directory is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We want to build a community that helps people learn to make cool and fun things along the way. We are trying to build interesting/cool/useful together.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community.

We are all working towards the same goal. There is no reason to behave like we are not all on the same team.

## 2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.
*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
*   Behave as though we are a Team.
    
    * It is expected that you behave like it is a workplace and everyone here is your colleague, regardless of experience level or personal feelings.

*  Being **Heavily Opinionated** is Frowned Upon
*  Laughing is **Heavily** Endorsed


## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:


*   Doing or saying anything that is: sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, threats of violence or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language, makes you an Asshole. 
*   **Don't Be An Asshole**
*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. 

If anyone tells you to stop doing something that was mentioned above, it is expected you will do so.

If for some reason, anyone who is in charge of maintaining this repo/organization start behaving like this, we expect/would appreciate someone telling them to stop being an asshole. 

## 5. Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Mention @moderator in the [discord](https://discord.gg/ZeMcrJQ).
